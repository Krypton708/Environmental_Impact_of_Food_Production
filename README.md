# **Environmental Impact of Food Porduction**  
### *Analyzing the Environmental Impact of Food Production*  

## **Project Overview**  
Food production is a major driver of environmental challenges, including climate change, deforestation, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. This project aims to analyze the environmental footprint of various food products using data science techniques.  

The analysis covers:  
- **Carbon emissions** across different food categories.  
- **Land and water usage** per food item.  
- **Eutrophication impacts** (nutrient pollution).  
- **Sustainability insights** for policymakers, producers, and consumers.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset includes 43 common food products and their environmental impact across **23 metrics**, such as:  
- **Greenhouse gas emissions** (kg CO₂-equivalents per kg of product).  
- **Water usage** (liters per kg, per 100g protein, per 1000 kcal).  
- **Land use** (m² per kg, per 100g protein, per 1000 kcal).  
- **Stages of food production** (farm, transport, packaging, retail).
